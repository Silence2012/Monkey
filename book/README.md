⚠️ 🚫 Unfortunely， I don't get author's copyright about the content of this book (Write An Interpreter in Go) after I emailed him. Meanwhile, his code in the book, as well as my extension is under MIT license. If any publisher wants to buy the rights, I would like to be middleman。 

Don't be depressed, I will take down my total comprehension of this book chapter by chapter, and post in my personal blog website [https://gaufung.com](https://gaufung.com). If you interested in the detail, please subsrcibe my blog.
